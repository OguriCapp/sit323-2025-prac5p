This is a simple Containerisation of a simple web application using Docker. 
And the main functionality is the same as my previous Task4.2C, which includes add, subtract, power and so on.

For this task, I created a Dockerfile and a docker-compose.yml file to containerize the application. 
After setting up the necessary files, I successfully built and deployed the Docker (By using Docker Desktop).
And the application runs correctly inside a container.

To run this project, you need to:
clone this project and then type "npm start" on your terminal.
